# MobileCalculator
This application is a straightforward calculator supporting evaluation of complex formulas and input support inspiredby Samsung's calculator app.

Unlike some clunky calculators, like Windows's default one, this program allows the user to input a whole expression to compute.

Input support helps by providing shortcuts such as:
- Inputting a decimal point by itself will insert a 0 before the decimal point in appriopriate situations. (5*. -> 5*0.)
- There is a single button for parenthesis automatically keeping track of whether an opening or a closing bracket is suitable.
- Inputting an operation (*,/,+,-) after a different operation changes the previous one.
- And more
